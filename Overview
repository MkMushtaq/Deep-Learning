The two python programs above implement a 4 layer Artificial Neural Network.
In the sine_ann_backprop program the NN tries to learn from the given data to transform itself into a sine function.
The power_plant_problem program contains a 4 layer neural network which is trained on a Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set.

The ANN Document contains the result obtained after carrying out the training in visual forms, and the parameters of the ANN.
